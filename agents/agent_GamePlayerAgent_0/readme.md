## `GamePlayerAgent_0`

A minimal client that polls the keyboard, sends input ticks at 20 Hz, and renders the serverâ€™s `world_state` in a fixed window.

## Behavior

<details>
<summary><b>(Click to expand)</b> The agent goes through these steps:</summary>
<br>

1. Start a background Summoner client thread.
2. `@client.send("gm/tick")` every 50 ms

   * Captures WASD or arrow keys into `keys` and stamps `ts`.
3. `@client.receive("gm/reply")`

   * Updates a shared snapshot with `bounds`, `players`, and `ts`.
4. Pygame UI loop

   * Draws circles for players and a simple HUD with PID and player count.
5. Hooks

   * `@client.hook(Direction.RECEIVE)` normalizes envelopes.
   * `@client.hook(Direction.SEND)` injects `pid` if missing.
